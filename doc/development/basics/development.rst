Development
===========

    The general development consists of a variety of tasks reaching from documentation, writing stories, implementing,
    generating content like art, sound, voice and a lot more. To structure the development progress you can find some
    instructions here how things should be done in general.


Stories & Tasks
---------------

    The pieces of work should be always stories and tasks. Sometimes you will come across the term *Epic* which
    means a bundle of stories regarding a specific theme. A Story is a piece of written something describing what
    shall be done and when it is counted as accomplished. The person who in fact tackles the Story is obligated to
    break down the story into pieces called tasks which should be at the end of the so called planning process the
    complete list of steps necessary for completing the story.

Branching Model
---------------

    To get out features regularly there shall be a branching model once the first test version is released.
    In general there is a main branch on which everything goes. From this we will regularly draw a branch with a
    specific version in incremental order. On those branches it is not allowed to continue working on features.
    They are considered stable and are only allowed being changed by bug fixes regarding critical issues.
