Tools
=====

Currently we use a small variety of tools in the development process. Sooner or later there will be some
additional tools used and to give a quick overview this should help.

Pycharm - Integrated development environment (IDE)
**************************************************

If you plan to program a lot you will need a IDE. A good one is PyCharm which is available as a community edition.

Gimp - Draw it
**************

If you need to make graphical adjustments the free program gimp should give you a hand.

Tiled - Level Editing
*********************

For preparing our levels we use the `Tiled-Editor <http://www.mapeditor.org/>`_

Documentation - Write it down
*****************************

We use Sphinx for documenting everything which is necessary. It uses RST files which are easy and quick to change
and maintain. Furthermore they allow linking to python code.
