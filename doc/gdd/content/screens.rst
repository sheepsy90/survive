Screens
*******

    There are three main screens currently available in the game. There is the login screen which is used for authentication
    with a login server, followed by the character selection screen with four slots per account. Finally we have the game
    screen showing the character and the health status icons on the left side and some controls on the right side. In the
    middle part the game drawing surface is present.
