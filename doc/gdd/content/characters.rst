Characters
==========

Character Creation
******************
In the game there will be different characters that can be chosen by the player. In detail the player isn't
allowed to choose the attributes of the character due to the fact that they will depend on the back story
of the character. A character in this universe can have several properties namely:

Character Name
--------------
    The character will get a random name drawn from a predefined dictionary of forenames and surnames.
    This will of course be chosen depending of the biological gender the person is assigned to.

Character Gender
----------------
    In terms of gender the character can be either male or female which in general doesn't make a difference in
    game play. This is just for traditional purposes and to give an orientation which graphic as a character
    portrait might be chosen.

History
-------
    Each character gets a background story defining what the character did before the troubling events happened.
    There shall be a dictionary or some sort of generic pool which we can choose from. Some historic elements
    are then assigned a special attribute which is permanent bound to the character on creation.
    This allows for a wide variety of characters and furthermore quite unique combinations. Furthermore each
    piece of history gets a four dimensional vector assigned too which reflects the four main key card components.
    Depending of the addition of that the character gets the initial key card. It is possible to choose either the
    dominant component first and then search for a sufficient history or do it the other way round.

Permanent Bound Attributes
--------------------------
    Influenced by the history at the beginning the character gets a set of permanent health modifiers which restrict
    or increase certain aspects of the character. This could be something like shock resistance, durability or the
    ability to withstand hunger longer than other characters. Those attributes are assigned at the creation of the
    character and therefore fixed from the beginning.

    .. todo:: Maybe we could present five elements that result from history and let the player choose three of
              them and forget the other ones. Correctly communicated with memory this would make a nice way of
              choosing abilities.

Initial Key Card
----------------
    Each character gets an initial key card defined by the personal history the character has. How exactly this
    is determined needs to be specified further.


Character Progression
*********************
During the game the character can progress further which is reflected by the key card she owns.
Another kind of progressing during the game is by inventing items. When having resources and within
the safe zone there will be a place where new items can be invented. The invention is not in the style of
learning a new recipe - the character is able to build almost anything on its own - but it is really of the
style that you create an item suggestion and if it is added to the game your character will get a bonus for
coming up with that particular idea.

The progression in the game is not really linear and depends more on the key card you acquire. You
character can only have one particular key card at a time which is used for opening doors, accessing the
special areas in the safe zone designated for the specific level and building some advanced special stuff.

The cards can be acquired by achieving the victory in specific rooms or by doing a favour for one of the
designated NPCs (Quest).

.. todo:: At the beginning the cards will be dropped just like other items to let you access new rooms in the alpha.



Non Player Characters
*********************
Non player characters are only available in the central safe zone room. Those NPCs are designated to give you tasks
or give you a status report on the human population condition. As stated in the general section and in the map and
location part the safe zone is the zone which can't be overrun by robots. It therefore acts as the safe haven which
makes it plausible that the NPCs are located there. The NPCs will request you to donate items such as food water and
other stuff which is necessary. The detailed dynamic of this will be described in the game system section.

Just note that there will be several NPCs defined namely here with their back story and the designated duty.
