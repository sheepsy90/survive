Metrics
*******

    The metrics of the game world is still a matter of discussion and needs mainly a playtest to check whether players are
    confused with a non metric room topology which doesn't follow the perfect space restrictions like in the real world.
    If this turns out being not very problematic when there are small variations in the room structure its more easy
    to just build levels. In the other case we need more planning before design of the levels.
