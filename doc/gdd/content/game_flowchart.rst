Game Flowchart
==============

    To guide the player through the first stages of the game we need to make sure that the tutorial introduction
    level is appropriate and that the first rooms are well crafted for the purpose of understanding how the game
    works.

Tutorial / Introduction
***********************



    The player encounters the character selection after which a short sequence is been played showing the history of mankind
    and what lead to the arcology state of living for the entire rest of the human race. The intro shall tell some means of
    living and shall glimpse on some features of the game. If time and resources allow different characters shall have
    different into sequences telling especially from their perspective.\\
    The sequence ends with a retrospective view on the events that will happen in the tutorial.\\
    The tutorial itself will give the player a brief introduction into the game. The following mechanics will be presented to
    the player:

        - Flashlight, Air \& Atmosphere, Minimal Crafting, Looting, Using Items, Using Backpack

    After the tutorial the player is transported to one of the rescue stations which are distributed along the arcology.

Common Room
***********

    The player will be transported to the common room where he will first encounter an NPC with some
    sort of notification. This step should provide the player with the information on how to interact with NPCs.
    This first NPC tells him about the situation and then explains to the player that he should look for his
    specific area meeting point. This meeting point is referenced by the card the player owns.
    This results in the fact that the text the first NPCs will tell is changeable.


Specific Area
*************

    The meeting points are possible to reach within the common room and the guarding NPC will speak to the character the
    first time he passes through. He explains the ID card system and points out some general information that is necessary
    to know about the cards and the abilities. This requires the guards to check if a player already passed through the
    security once. At the end the NPC will ask the player to go look for some stuff which is necessary. This is
    generic right now but should motivate the player to get to the first set of rooms which include a simple puzzle each.


Puzzle Learning Area
********************

    The first area after the common room will be an area which has a set of small rooms which are all connected and
    can be opened by different ID cards. This shall give the player an intuition that he needs a specific type of card
    to open a door. This furthermore includes some rooms which are not accessible right now. The general layout of
    difficulty can be seen in the Map/Location page.
